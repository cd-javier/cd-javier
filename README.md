## Hi, I'm Javier ðŸ‘‹

**UX/UI Designer & Web Developer**

With a background in service and management, I bring a user-first mindset to everything I build. After diving deep into design thinking and usability, I transitioned into full-stack developmentâ€”where creativity meets functionality.

    class Designer {  
        constructor() {  
            this.creativity = "High";  
            this.focus = ["UX/UI Design", "User Research", "Design Thinking"];  
        }  
    }  

    class Developer extends Designer {  
        constructor() {  
            super();  
            this.languages = ["JavaScript", "React", "Node.js"];  
            this.tools = ["VS Code", "Git", "Figma"];  
            this.problemSolving = "Methodical & Efficient";  
        }  
    }  

    const javier = new Developer();
